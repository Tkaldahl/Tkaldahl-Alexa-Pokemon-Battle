## What Your Skill Will Do
The gamebook skill for Alexa is a self-contained mini text adventure.  Use Twine 2 to author a simple text adventure, export it, and Alexa will use it to structure the game for your user when they start your skill.  The purpose of building this skill is to teach you how the different pieces of the Alexa development process fit together, while still producing an interesting, useful skill that others can enjoy.

This Alexa skill template helps you create your first text adventure skill.  Your users will be able to say things like:

*  "Alexa, ask Lost In Space to go north."
*  "Alexa, start Titanic Adventure."
*  "Alexa, ask Lost In Space what I can see."

Alexa will respond to all of these requests with responses like these:

*  "You are in a cold damp cell. There are exits to the north and south."
*  "There is a skeleton here. Do you want to fight it?"
*  "You are in a dark room. A dog looks at you happily."
